# Dues-Notification

This is a python application intended to be a texting notification system for the KY Iota Chapter of Phi Delta Theta.
The code can be used by any other organization as long as a proper Twilio account has been set up and paid for. 
The recipients are loaded from an excel spreadsheet that requires a specific format to be followed. 

To Do: - Add sample recipients file with proper structure. 
       - Change file interaction so the recipients file stucture is not as rigid 
       - Add optional variable tag and possibly a user interface to edit this variable for all recipients in selected file
